# CodeRec

CodeRec is a website that allows you to compare two or more public profiles from GitHub, LeetCode, and CodeChef. You can see how your coding skills and achievements stack up against others by entering their usernames or profile URLs. CodeRec will fetch the user data from each platform and display it in charts and graphs for easy comparison.

The tech stacks used for this project are:

Frontend: React, HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Backend: Node.js, Express.js

GitHub API: to fetch user data

Chart.js: to create charts and graphs for the comparison data (Its not currently implemented, I'm working on it)

This project was inspired by a friend who wanted to compare his coding skills with others. The main challenge was to handle the different APIs and data formats of each platform. The future plans for this project include adding more features like filtering, sorting, and sharing the comparison results.
